# Spring Systems Full Stack Challange
Full stack challenge from Spring Systems, with company and employee data. PHP backend and MySQL database.

## Prompt
The purpose of this challenge is to test your ability to come up with solutions on your own. In this challenge you will write actual code for a small web application that will collect information using an online form.  The web application should collect the name and address of a company and store it into a database. The web application will need information about the company, as well as company employees. 

- There can be multiple employees per company. 
- The application will need a way to show all companies and the number of employees per company in a table. 
- Likewise the application will need to show each employee and their respective companies.
- Please use proper validation and data filtering when collecting information using the online form. 
- Write the SQL queries to create the database that will store this data. 

## My Solution
I decided to keep the html simple, but still make sure the requirements were met. There is a company and employee table on this project. While working on this project, I used Xampp, which includes an Apache server and MySQL server on my local computer. I added validation and prevented XXS by encoding the data before displaying. Also the validations should make sure to prevent the user from entering bad data. Overrall, this was an interesting project, and I'm glab to be apart of this challenge.
